                    <p>From April 2022 to May 2023, I served as a Senior Software Developer. Initially, I was assigned
                        to a
                        Blockchain and Solana's based project called Taki. This donation-centered social network is
                        housed
                        on Google Cloud, and it consists of two primary components. First, there is a Blockchain
                        project, which handles all "monetary" transactions. It was built with Node.js and offers a
                        GraphQL interface for service access, storing transactional data in PostgreSQL. The second
                        component is a user portal resembling Instagram, built using Next.js and React.js.
                        My next project was Kioksly, an internal Google project. This solution serves as a feedback
                        receiver using a dedicated mobile device. It collects user satisfaction feedback and issue data.
                        The application was developed using Android with Google's MDM for device administration,
                        Next.js, and React.js for a user interface compatible with both tablets (running inside an
                        Android WebView) and web.</p>

                        Office application. This solution, designed to manage customer sensitive documentation, was
                        implemented using Java Spring microservices, a React.js front-end, and an IBM DB2
                        database.
                        Additionally, I managed a significant project involving the mobile banking application. In
                        collaboration with the product's Spanish team, I led an efficient group of over 10
                        professionals. Together, we implemented hiring procedures and incorporated consultative and

                        Simultaneously, as the technical area leader, I invested time in defining the strategies for the

                        recruitment. Our selected tech stack for these solutions encompassed React.js, Node.js

                        for all projects. My tenure coincided with the product upgrade process, which included migrating
                        the front-end from .Aspx to Angular2, while maintaining the .NET backend.
                        Following the refactor, I was assigned to the Ficohsa project. This involved customizing and
                        implementing the new product solution. Leading a team of 12 developers, we successfully executed
                        the project. After moving the project to evolutionary maintenance mode, I was reassigned to the
                        Republic Bank project in Trinidad and Tobago. However, I was unable to see this project to its
                        conclusion as I left the company to embark on a new venture.</p>

                        implement a new solution for financial institutions. The primary tech stack for these projects
                        included Java, JQuery, JQuery Mobile, and Android.</p>

                    <p>From January 2012 to June 2014, I held the position of Tech Lead Consultant within the banking
                        and financial mobility team. Our focus was on developing web and mobile solutions for financial
                        institutions, targeted at their clients and employees. Notably, I was involved in the Sybase 365
                        Mobiliser project (a mobile wallet).
                        This project consisted of a Java-based financial core (utilizing OSGi, Spring, and Hibernate)
                        and an Oracle database. The solution was implemented as a RESTful/SOAP API to be consumed
                        through various channels - web (Wicket), mobile (Android and iOS), and SMS. My responsibilities
                        spanned all stages of development, including design and quality control of deliverables.</p>

                        implementation of solutions for sales services and fundamental telephony services, utilizing C++
                        for development.</p>
