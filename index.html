                    <p>Since January <b>2024</b>, I have been working on two key AI-driven financial analysis projects:

                    <p>The first project, Financial Analyst, is a Next.js/Python-based solution that leverages Claude AI models to analyze clients' financial data. The system generates comprehensive graphical reports and includes an interactive chat interface that allows users to efficiently query and interact with their financial data.</p>

                    <p>The second project, Amoeba AI, focuses on integrated marketing and financial analysis. This platform enables users to upload their data and interact with it through an AI-powered financial analyst interface. The solution is built on OpenAI's technology stack, utilizing React/Next.js for the frontend and Nest.js for the backend implementation, creating a seamless and intuitive user experience for complex financial analysis tasks.</p>

                    <div class="subheading mb-3">Mesh.id</div>
                    <p>From May <b>2023</b> to January <b>2024</b>, I served as a Senior Fullstack Software Engineer, focusing on
                        developing verification workflows for businesses and professionals in the USA. This project
                        leveraged a robust event-driven architecture and used a serverless approach using AWS Lambda
                        to ensure efficiency and scalability. The front-end was built with React.js, offering a dynamic
                        and user-friendly interface.

                        On the backend, we used DynamoDB for streamlined database management. The architecture was
                        further enhanced with AWS Cognito for secure user authentication, integrating multiple
                        microservices to maintain a modular and focused system. Our approach included sophisticated data
                        scraping strategies to efficiently gather necessary information.

                        Security was paramount, given the sensitive nature of the customer data we handled. We adhered
                        strictly to AWS's security best practices to safeguard this information, ensuring the integrity
                        and confidentiality of our systems. This project not only highlighted the technical prowess of
                        our team but also significantly impacted our clients by streamlining their verification
                        processes, thereby enhancing their operational efficiency and security posture.

                        From April <b>2021</b> to May <b>2023</b>, I worked as a Senior Fullstack Software Engineer. I
                        started
                        off with a project called Taki, a blockchain-based social network focused on donations, using
                        Solana and hosted on Google Cloud. The project has two main parts: the blockchain side, which
                        deals with all the transactions, developed with Node.js and Express, and uses GraphQL for
                        connecting services, storing all transaction data in PostgreSQL. The second part is a user
                        interface similar to Instagram, created with Next.js and React.js, designed to handle a large
                        number of users and posts, which was a significant challenge to support.

                        Later, I worked on Kioskly, an internal Google project mounted on Google Cloud Platform. It's a
                        feedback collection tool that uses a specialized mobile device to gather feedback on user
                        satisfaction and issues. The app was built using Android, with Google's MDM for device
                        management, and used Next.js and React.js for a user interface that works on both tablets
                        (inside an Android WebView) and web browsers.</p>

                        most strategic projects. One of my key contributions was leading the development of a new Back

                        implemented using Java Spring microservices, a React.js front-end, and an IBM DB2
                        database.
                        Additionally, I managed a significant project involving the mobile banking application. In
                        collaboration with the product's Spanish team, I led an efficient group of over 10
                        professionals. Together, we implemented hiring procedures and incorporated consultative and

                    <p>From August <b>2018</b> to October <b>2019</b>, I served as a Principal Software Engineer and
                        Solutions Architect at 2innovateIT.
                        Specializing in the financial sector, I spearheaded three key projects for our main client in
                        Mexico, Banco Sabadell, related to the transactional engine and Back Office operations.
                        Simultaneously, as the technical area leader, I invested time in defining the strategies for the
                        new development sector in Mexico, designing new products, mentoring junior staff, and overseeing
                        recruitment. Our selected tech stack for these solutions encompassed React.js, Node.js
                        microservices, and PostgreSQL.

                    <p>From December <b>2015</b> to August <b>2018</b>, I served as a Principal Software Engineer on
                        home and corporate
                        banking solution
                        projects. Initially, I was part of the product team responsible for developing the base solution
                        for all projects. My tenure coincided with the product upgrade process, which included migrating
                        the front-end from .Aspx to Angular2, while maintaining the .NET backend.
                        Following the refactor, I was assigned to the Ficohsa project. This involved customizing and
                        implementing the new product solution. Leading a team of 12 developers, we successfully executed
                        the project. After moving the project to evolutionary maintenance mode, I was reassigned to the
                        Republic Bank project in Trinidad and Tobago. However, I was unable to see this project to its
                        conclusion as I left the company to embark on a new venture.</p>

                    <p>From Janury <b>2012</b> to December <b>2015</b>, I held the position of Principal Software
                        Engineer
                        within the banking
                        and financial mobility team. Our focus was on developing web and mobile solutions for financial
                        institutions, targeted at their clients and employees. Notably, I was involved in the Sybase 365
                        Mobiliser project (a mobile wallet).
                        After the mentioned project I continued in my previous role but with expanded responsibilities.
                        These included designing architectural
                        solutions for new products, conducting research, and providing support for existing projects
                        with our primary client, TODO1 Services.

                        I was assigned to two projects - Bancolombia and Davivienda eBanking, spending approximately six
                        months on each. Following these assignments, I was placed in the product area to design and
                        implement a new solution for financial institutions. The primary tech stack for these projects
                        included Java, JQuery, JQuery Mobile, and Android.</p>
